# Project Title
* This code is a simple password generator. Here's a description of what it does:


- The code prompts the user to input the desired length of the password and whether they - - want to include letters (both lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and special characters.
- It then generates a password based on the user's preferences and copies it to the system clipboard.
- If the user doesn't select any character types, it prints an error message.
